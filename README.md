#  Iris Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project implements the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements. The model is trained, tuned, and evaluated using the classic Iris dataset.

---

## 📁 Dataset
- **File:** `Iris.csv`
- **Target:** `Species` (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

---

## ✅ Project Highlights
- Feature normalization using StandardScaler
- Train/test split and model training using KNN
- Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Tuning `K` value and visualizing its effect on accuracy
- Plotting decision boundaries using two features

---

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## 📊 Result
- High accuracy (>90%) achieved on the Iris dataset
- Optimal K value determined using testing loop
- Visualizations help interpret how KNN separates classes
